#Pepsi Pinball Tribute - Physics 2
This is a tribute to a Pinball made by Pepsi with a western theme! We made this for an assignment of our Physics 2 class, using the Box2D library.

##Controls

You can use the arrow keys left and right to use the flippers.
Press F1 to access debug functions. While on debug you can see all the shapes of the bodies, and you can click on them to move them around (if they're dynamic and don't have a joint).

Check the upper border of your window to see how many lifes, points, and how much your points are multiplying for! You can also see the score from the last player.

##Missing Features

In our game, the following features are missing:
- Start animation with flashing lights everywhere.
- Bonus points at the end of each ball.
- Score/ball on screen.
- Saloon Minigame - We did an animation with red windows and added a lot of points to the score instead.
- Bridge Start- Our ball starts straight in the horse, it doesn't come from the bridge.
